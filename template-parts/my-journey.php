               <h2>I started my career as a middle school teacher.</h2>
               <p class="lead">It was fulfilling a fulfilling three years trying to create bilingual and compassionate
                  global citizens.
                  One day as I watched the copy machine mechanically eject grammar worksheets, the soothing sound of scanned paper entranced
                  me to note these perfect paper stacks are a metaphor for the monotony of my life.
                  I knew in that moment I needed to make a change.
                  Fortunately, I was wrapping up a Masters in English and took a writing faculty position for Missouri State University,
                  which turned out to be in China.

                  Back home there were always distractions keeping me from addressing this question and now there was nothing - except
                  the overwhelming feeling of purposelessness.
